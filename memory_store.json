Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n- Visualizing the vulnerability of various sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sector_data)**  \n  Plots a bar chart showing how vulnerable different sectors are to quantum attacks, based on provided scores.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class)**  \n  Implements the Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS), a hash-based, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme.\n  - `generate_keypair()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n  - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n  - `verify(message, signature, public_key)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n- **main()**  \n  Runs the analysis and demonstration:\n  - Plots sector vulnerabilities.\n  - Demonstrates key generation, signing, and verification with Lamport OTS, including a tampered message test.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   Save the code to a `.py` file and execute:\n      python script_name.py\n   \n\n3. **Output:**  \n   - A bar chart visualizing sector vulnerabilities.\n   - Console output showing Lamport OTS signature generation, validation, and detection of tampering.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:**  \n  Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n- **Sector vulnerability scores are illustrative:**  \n  Real-world risk assessments may differ.\n- **No persistent storage:**  \n  Keys and signatures exist only in memory during execution.\n- **Quantum resistance:**  \n  Lamport OTS is believed to be resistant to quantum attacks, but practical deployment requires more robust schemes (e.g., Merkle signatures).\n\n---",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing the vulnerability of various industry sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant cryptographic primitive: the Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions / Classes\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the relative vulnerability of different sectors to quantum computing attacks.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is resistant to quantum attacks.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time key pair (private and public keys).\n    - `sign(message, sk)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, pk)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use / Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   Execute the script directly:\n      python script_name.py\n   \n\n3. **What happens:**  \n   - A bar chart will be displayed, visualizing sector vulnerabilities.\n   - The Lamport OTS demo will:\n     - Generate a key pair.\n     - Sign a sample message.\n     - Verify the signature (should be valid).\n     - Attempt verification on a tampered message (should be invalid).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes / Limitations\n\n- **Data:**  \n  - Vulnerability scores are illustrative and not based on real-world measurements.\n\n- **Lamport OTS:**\n  - **One-time use only:** Each key pair must only be used to sign a single message.\n  - **Not for production:** This is a demonstration; real-world post-quantum cryptography requires more robust schemes and secure key management.\n  - **Large keys/signatures:** Lamport OTS is not space-efficient compared to modern schemes.\n\n- **Visualization:**  \n  - The chart is for illustrative purposes and does not reflect actual sector vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a basic overview and demonstration of quantum threats to cybersecurity, visualizes at-risk sectors, and introduces a simple quantum-resistant signature scheme for educational purposes.",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by visualizing the vulnerability of various sectors to quantum attacks. It also demonstrates a sample implementation of a quantum-resistant, hash-based digital signature scheme\u2014Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing how vulnerable different sectors are to quantum computing attacks based on hypothetical scores.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a simple Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - **keygen():** Generates a private/public key pair for Lamport OTS.\n    - **sign(message):** Signs a message using the private key.\n    - **verify(message, signature, public_key):** Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Execution:**  \n   - Run the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Generate a Lamport OTS key pair.\n     - Sign a sample message.\n     - Verify the signature (should be valid).\n     - Attempt verification on a tampered message (should be invalid).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is One-Time Only:**  \n  Each key pair must only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n\n- **Demonstration Purposes Only:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n\n- **Vulnerability Scores are Hypothetical:**  \n  The sector vulnerability data is illustrative and not based on real-world assessments.\n\n- **No Key Management:**  \n  The code does not handle secure key storage or management.\n\n- **Quantum Resistance:**  \n  Lamport OTS is considered quantum-resistant, but practical deployment requires more advanced schemes (e.g., Merkle signatures).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visualization of quantum-related cybersecurity risks and a hands-on demonstration of a basic quantum-resistant signature algorithm.

How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Execution:**  \n   - Run the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Generate a Lamport OTS key pair.\n     - Sign a sample message.\n     - Verify the signature (should be valid).\n     - Attempt verification on a tampered message (should be invalid).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is One-Time Only:**  \n  Each key pair must only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n\n- **Demonstration Purposes Only:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n\n- **Vulnerability Scores are Hypothetical:**  \n  The sector vulnerability data is illustrative and not based on real-world assessments.\n\n- **No Key Management:**  \n  The code does not handle secure key storage or management.\n\n- **Quantum Resistance:**  \n  Lamport OTS is considered quantum-resistant, but practical deployment requires more advanced schemes (e.g., Merkle signatures).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visualization of quantum-related cybersecurity risks and a hands-on demonstration of a basic quantum-resistant signature algorithm.

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing the vulnerability of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a data visualization and a sample implementation of a hash-based signature algorithm, which is resistant to quantum attacks (unlike RSA/ECC).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing the vulnerability scores (0-10) of various sectors to quantum threats.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme.\n    - `generate_keypair()`: Generates a private/public key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message (bytes) using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, public_key=None)`: Verifies a signature for a given message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Running the Code:**  \n   - Save the script as a `.py` file.\n   - Run from the command line:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Demonstrate Lamport OTS: generate keys, sign a message, verify the signature, and show verification failure on a tampered message.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is for demonstration only:**  \n  - It is a \"one-time\" signature: each key pair must only be used to sign one message.\n  - Not suitable for production or real-world cryptographic use without enhancements (e.g., key management, Merkle trees).\n  - The implementation is simplified and not hardened for security.\n\n- **Vulnerability scores are illustrative:**  \n  - The sector vulnerability data is hypothetical and for visualization purposes only.\n\n- **Quantum-resistance:**  \n  - Lamport OTS is believed to be secure against quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC.\n\n- **Error Handling:**  \n  - Basic error handling is included, but not exhaustive.\n\n---\n\n**",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- **Visualizing** the vulnerability of various critical sectors to quantum attacks.\n- **Demonstrating** a simplified, sample implementation of a quantum-resistant (lattice-based) key exchange algorithm.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores)**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability of each sector to quantum threats.\n\n- **hash_function(data: bytes)**\n  - Computes a SHA-256 hash of the input data (used in key generation and secret derivation).\n\n- **generate_private_key(length=32)**\n  - Generates a cryptographically secure random private key of specified length.\n\n- **generate_public_key(private_key: bytes, public_param: bytes)**\n  - Creates a public key by hashing the concatenation of a private key and a public parameter (for demonstration only).\n\n- **derive_shared_secret(private_key: bytes, other_public_key: bytes)**\n  - Derives a shared secret by hashing the concatenation of a private key and the other party's public key.\n\n- **demo_lattice_key_exchange()**\n  - Demonstrates the key exchange process between two parties (Alice and Bob) using the above primitives and prints the resulting shared secrets.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed (`pip install matplotlib numpy`)\n\n2. **Run the Script:**  \n   - Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `quantum_cybersecurity_demo.py`)\n   - Execute:  \n          python quantum_cybersecurity_demo.py\n     \n\n3. **Output:**  \n   - A bar chart visualizing sector vulnerabilities.\n   - Console output showing the key exchange process and whether both parties derive the same shared secret.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes & Limitations\n\n- **Visualization Data:**  \n  - Vulnerability scores are hypothetical and for demonstration only.\n\n- **Quantum-Resistant Algorithm:**  \n  - The lattice-based key exchange is highly simplified and **not secure** for real-world use.\n  - Real implementations should use standardized, peer-reviewed algorithms (e.g., Kyber, NTRU).\n\n- **Security",

Robust defences on historical data take many years, so it is advisable to start migration now. Connected to this, the American public agency, The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has been developing classical encryption standards designed against quantum computing, such as Shor\u2019s and Grover\u2019s algorithms, and the official standards will likely be [...] A standard approach combines classical and PQC algorithms in a hybrid system. Unique to the hybrid, classical-PQC system is its dual security. Its PQC element is meant to protect against quantum decryption. Conversely, in the event of an unforeseen classical exploit in the new Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, the reliable classical component of the hybrid system would remain steadfast. This hybrid approach simultaneously maintains necessary certifications and compliance standards.",

Description\n\nThis script analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- **Visualizing** which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (using a bar chart).\n- **Demonstrating** a simple, toy implementation of a quantum-resistant (lattice-based) encryption scheme, showing basic key generation, encryption, and decryption of a single bit.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n### Data Visualization\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores)**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing hypothetical vulnerability scores (0-100) for various industry sectors to quantum computing threats.\n\n### Toy Lattice-based Encryption (Quantum-Resistant)\n\n- **generate_keypair(n=8, q=257)**\n  - Generates a toy public/private key pair for a lattice-based cryptosystem.\n  - Returns: `(public_key, private_key)`.\n\n- **encrypt_bit(bit, public_key, q=257)**\n  - Encrypts a single bit (0 or 1) using the public key.\n  - Returns: `(u, v)` ciphertext.\n\n- **decrypt_bit(ciphertext, sk, q=257)**\n  - Decrypts a single bit from the ciphertext using the private key.\n  - Returns: `bit` (0 or 1).\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Use / Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Running the Script:**  \n   - Save the code to a `.py` file.\n   - Run from the command line:  \n          python your_script.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Run a demo of the toy lattice-based encryption: generate keys, encrypt a bit, decrypt it, and print the results.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Important Notes & Limitations\n\n- **Visualization Data:**  \n  - The vulnerability scores are hypothetical and for demonstration only.\n\n- **Encryption Algorithm:**  \n  - The lattice-based encryption is a **toy example** for educational purposes.\n  - It is **not secure** for real-world use. Real post-quantum cryptography is significantly more complex.\n  - Only supports encryption of a single bit at a time.\n\n- **Error",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the potential impact of quantum computing on various cybersecurity sectors, visualizes sector vulnerabilities, and demonstrates a simple quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature, OTS).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic, hash-based, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time private/public key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, public_key=None)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Packages: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   - Execute the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Demonstrate Lamport OTS: sign a message, verify the signature, and show that tampering with the message invalidates the signature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature scheme:**  \n  - Each key pair should only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **Vulnerability scores are hypothetical:**  \n  - The sector vulnerability data is illustrative, not based on real-world assessments.\n- **No persistent key storage:**  \n  - Keys exist only in memory for demonstration.\n- **Lamport OTS is for educational/demo purposes:**  \n  - Not suitable for production use due to key/signature size and one-time limitation.\n- **Quantum resistance:**  \n  - Lamport OTS is believed to be secure against quantum attacks, unlike many classical signature schemes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visual overview of quantum threats to cybersecurity sectors and a hands-on example of a quantum-resistant signature, highlighting the need for post-quantum cryptography.",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the potential impact of quantum computing on various cybersecurity sectors, visualizes sector vulnerabilities, and demonstrates a simple quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature, OTS).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic, hash-based, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time private/public key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, public_key=None)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Packages: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   - Execute the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Demonstrate Lamport OTS: sign a message, verify the signature, and show that tampering with the message invalidates the signature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature scheme:**  \n  - Each key pair should only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **Vulnerability scores are hypothetical:**  \n  - The sector vulnerability data is illustrative, not based on real-world assessments.\n- **No persistent key storage:**  \n  - Keys exist only in memory for demonstration.\n- **Lamport OTS is for educational/demo purposes:**  \n  - Not suitable for production use due to key/signature size and one-time limitation.\n- **Quantum resistance:**  \n  - Lamport OTS is believed to be secure against quantum attacks, unlike many classical signature schemes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visual overview of quantum threats to cybersecurity sectors and a hands-on example of a quantum-resistant signature, highlighting the need for post-quantum cryptography.",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing the estimated vulnerability of various sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant cryptographic primitive: the Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme.\n- Providing a sample implementation and demonstration of signing and verifying messages using Lamport OTS.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n#### **Visualization**\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability (in %) of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n\n#### **Quantum-Resistant Algorithm**\n- **LamportOTS class:**\n  - Implements the Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, a basic post-quantum (quantum-resistant) signature algorithm.\n  - **keygen():** Generates a private/public key pair.\n  - **sign(message):** Signs a message (as bytes) using the private key.\n  - **verify(message, signature, public_key=None):** Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n#### **Demonstration**\n- **demo_lamport_ots():**\n  - Demonstrates key generation, signing, and verification using Lamport OTS, including a test with a tampered message.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `numpy` installed:\n      pip install matplotlib numpy\n   \n\n2. **Run the Script:**  \n   Execute the script directly:\n      python <script_name>.py\n   \n   - This will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate Lamport OTS signing and verification, printing results to the console.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature scheme:**  \n  Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **Demo is for educational purposes:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n- **Sector vulnerability data is illustrative:**  \n  The vulnerability percentages are example estimates, not based on real-world analysis.\n- **No persistent key storage:**  \n  Keys are generated and used in-memory only.\n- **Quantum-resistance:**",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (based on reliance on classical cryptography).\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a visual overview and a sample implementation of a post-quantum cryptographic primitive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing vulnerability scores (0\u2013100) for various sectors, illustrating which are most at risk from quantum computing threats.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class):**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature)`: Verifies a signature against a message and the public key.\n\n- **main():**\n  - Runs the visualization and demonstrates the Lamport OTS by signing and verifying a message, and showing signature invalidity if the message is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**\n   - Python 3.x\n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**\n      python script_name.py\n   \n   - The script will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate the Lamport OTS by signing a message, verifying it, and showing that tampering with the message causes verification to fail.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:** Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:** The LamportOTS implementation is educational and not suitable for production use.\n- **No persistent key storage:** Keys are generated in-memory and discarded after use.\n- **Vulnerability data is illustrative:** The sector vulnerability scores are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only.\n- **Quantum resistance:** The Lamport OTS is secure against known quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC, but is not practical for general use due to large key/signature sizes",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (based on reliance on classical cryptography).\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a visual overview and a sample implementation of a post-quantum cryptographic primitive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing vulnerability scores (0\u2013100) for various sectors, illustrating which are most at risk from quantum computing threats.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class):**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature)`: Verifies a signature against a message and the public key.\n\n- **main():**\n  - Runs the visualization and demonstrates the Lamport OTS by signing and verifying a message, and showing signature invalidity if the message is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**\n   - Python 3.x\n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**\n      python script_name.py\n   \n   - The script will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate the Lamport OTS by signing a message, verifying it, and showing that tampering with the message causes verification to fail.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:** Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:** The LamportOTS implementation is educational and not suitable for production use.\n- **No persistent key storage:** Keys are generated in-memory and discarded after use.\n- **Vulnerability data is illustrative:** The sector vulnerability scores are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only.\n- **Quantum resistance:** The Lamport OTS is secure against known quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC, but is not practical for general use due to large key/signature sizes",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (based on reliance on classical cryptography).\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a visual overview and a sample implementation of a post-quantum cryptographic primitive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing vulnerability scores (0\u2013100) for various sectors, illustrating which are most at risk from quantum computing threats.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class):**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature)`: Verifies a signature against a message and the public key.\n\n- **main():**\n  - Runs the visualization and demonstrates the Lamport OTS by signing and verifying a message, and showing signature invalidity if the message is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**\n   - Python 3.x\n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**\n      python script_name.py\n   \n   - The script will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate the Lamport OTS by signing a message, verifying it, and showing that tampering with the message causes verification to fail.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:** Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:** The LamportOTS implementation is educational and not suitable for production use.\n- **No persistent key storage:** Keys are generated in-memory and discarded after use.\n- **Vulnerability data is illustrative:** The sector vulnerability scores are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only.\n- **Quantum resistance:** The Lamport OTS is secure against known quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC, but is not practical for general use due to large key/signature sizes",

It provides a function `bubble_sort` that returns a new sorted list without modifying the original input.\n\n---\n\n**2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose**\n\n- **bubble_sort(arr):**\n  - **Purpose:** Sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order using bubble sort.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - `arr` (list): The list of elements to sort.\n  - **Returns:** \n    - A new sorted list.\n  - **Raises:** \n    - `TypeError` if the input is not a list or contains elements that cannot be compared.\n\nThere are no custom classes in this code.\n\n---\n\n**3. How to Use/Run the Code**\n\n1. Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `bubble_sort_example.py`).\n2. Run the script using Python:\n      python bubble_sort_example.py\n   \n3. The script will print the original list and the sorted list as a demonstration.\n\nYou can also import the `bubble_sort` function into your own code and use it as follows:\nfrom bubble_sort_example import bubble_sort\nsorted_list = bubble_sort([3, 1, 2])\n\n---\n\n**4. Important Notes or Limitations**\n\n- The function only works with lists whose elements are mutually comparable (e.g., all integers or all strings).\n- If elements of different, uncomparable types are present, a `TypeError` will be raised.\n- The original input list is not modified; a sorted copy is returned.\n- Bubble sort is not efficient for large datasets (average and worst-case time complexity: O(n\u00b2)). For large lists, consider using Python\u2019s built-in `sorted()` function.\n- The function checks if the input is a list and raises a `TypeError` otherwise.",

Brief Description\n\nThis Python script creates a simple desktop dashboard using Tkinter to display recent research articles on solar cells. The dashboard presents article details (title, authors, year, journal, and link) in a table. Users can double-click a row to open the article link in their web browser and can refresh the data displayed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n### `SolarCellDashboard` (Class)\n- **Purpose:** Main application window. Inherits from `tk.Tk`.\n- **Key Methods:**\n  - `__init__`: Initializes the window, sets title and size, and calls widget creation.\n  - `create_widgets`: Builds the GUI components:\n    - Title label\n    - Table (`ttk.Treeview`) to display articles\n    - Refresh button\n    - Binds double-clicks to open article links\n  - `on_double_click`: Event handler that opens the article link in the default web browser when a table row is double-clicked.\n  - `refresh_data`: Clears and reloads the table data (simulates refreshing; in a real app, would fetch new data).\n\n### `RESEARCH_DATA` (List of Dicts)\n- **Purpose:** Sample data containing recent solar cell research articles. Each dictionary holds article details.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - No external libraries needed (uses standard library: `tkinter`, `webbrowser`)\n\n2. **Running the Code:**  \n   - Save the code to a file, e.g., `solar_cell_dashboard.py`\n   - Run in terminal or command prompt:\n          python solar_cell_dashboard.py\n     \n   - The dashboard window will appear.\n\n3. **Usage:**\n   - **View Articles:** Browse the table for recent research articles.\n   - **Open Article:** Double-click any row to open the article link in your default web browser.\n   - **Refresh:** Click the \"Refresh\" button to reload the data (in this demo, data remains the same).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Demo Data:** The articles are hardcoded; in a real application, you would fetch data from an API or database.\n- **No Search/Filter:** The dashboard does not support searching or filtering articles.\n- **",

Brief Description\n\nThis Python script creates a simple desktop dashboard (GUI) using Tkinter to display recent research articles on solar cells. Users can search, filter, and browse a table of articles, and double-click any entry to open the article link in their web browser.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n### `SolarCellDashboard (tk.Tk)`\n- **Purpose:** Main application window and logic controller.\n- **Key Methods:**\n    - `__init__`: Initializes the window, sets title/size, and creates widgets.\n    - `create_widgets`: Builds the search bar, table (Treeview), and scrollbar. Binds events for searching and opening links.\n    - `load_data(data)`: Loads a list of research articles into the table.\n    - `perform_search(event=None)`: Filters articles based on the search query (title, authors, or journal).\n    - `reset_search()`: Clears the search and reloads all articles.\n    - `open_link(event)`: Opens the selected article's link in the default web browser.\n\n### `RESEARCH_DATA`\n- **Purpose:** Sample data (list of dictionaries) representing recent research articles. In a real application, this would be loaded from a database or API.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n**Requirements:**  \n- Python 3.x  \n- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Save the code to a file, e.g., `solar_cell_dashboard.py`.\n2. Run the script:\n      python solar_cell_dashboard.py\n   \n3. The dashboard window will open:\n    - Use the search bar to filter articles by title, author, or journal.\n    - Click \"Reset\" to clear the search.\n    - Double-click any article row to open its link in your default browser.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Static Data:** The research articles are hardcoded. For real-world use, replace `RESEARCH_DATA` with data fetched from a database or API.\n- **Basic Search:** Search is case-insensitive and matches substrings in title, authors, or journal fields.\n- **No Editing:** The dashboard is read-only; you cannot add, edit, or delete articles from the GUI.\n- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included for opening links",

Brief Description\n\nThis Python script creates a simple desktop dashboard using Tkinter to display the latest research articles on solar cells from arXiv. It fetches recent articles via the arXiv API, parses the results, and presents them in a table. Users can refresh the data and view article details in a popup window.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n- **fetch_solar_cell_research()**\n  - Fetches the 10 most recent arXiv articles related to solar cells using the arXiv API.\n  - Handles network errors and returns a list of parsed articles.\n\n- **parse_arxiv_response(xml_text)**\n  - Performs basic parsing of the arXiv XML response using regular expressions.\n  - Extracts article title, authors, summary, published date, and link for each entry.\n\n- **update_dashboard()**\n  - Calls the fetch function and updates the Tkinter Treeview with the latest articles.\n\n- **show_article_details(event)**\n  - Displays a popup with full details (title, authors, summary, link) for the selected article when a user double-clicks a row.\n\n- **Tkinter GUI Setup**\n  - Sets up the main window, Treeview table, refresh button, and event bindings.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- Python 3.x\n- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `solar_cell_dashboard.py`).\n2. Run the script:\n      python solar_cell_dashboard.py\n   \n3. The dashboard window will appear, showing the latest solar cell research from arXiv.\n4. Double-click any article row to view its full details.\n5. Click the \"Refresh\" button to reload the latest articles.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes / Limitations\n\n- **Parsing:** The XML parsing is basic and uses regular expressions, which may not handle all edge cases. For robust parsing, consider using an XML parser like `xml.etree.ElementTree`.\n- **API Limits:** The script fetches only the 10 most recent articles. You can adjust `max_results` in the API URL for more/less.\n- **Internet Required:** Requires an active internet connection to fetch data from arXiv.\n-",

Brief Description\n\nThis Python script creates a simple desktop dashboard using Tkinter to display the latest research articles on solar cells from arXiv. It fetches recent articles via the arXiv API, parses the results, and presents them in a table. Users can refresh the data and view article details in a popup window.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n- **fetch_solar_cell_research()**\n  - Fetches the 10 most recent arXiv articles related to solar cells using the arXiv API.\n  - Handles network errors and returns a list of parsed articles.\n\n- **parse_arxiv_response(xml_text)**\n  - Performs basic parsing of the arXiv XML response using regular expressions.\n  - Extracts article title, authors, summary, published date, and link for each entry.\n\n- **update_dashboard()**\n  - Calls the fetch function and updates the Tkinter Treeview with the latest articles.\n\n- **show_article_details(event)**\n  - Displays a popup with full details (title, authors, summary, link) for the selected article when a user double-clicks a row.\n\n- **Tkinter GUI Setup**\n  - Sets up the main window, Treeview table, refresh button, and event bindings.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- Python 3.x\n- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `solar_cell_dashboard.py`).\n2. Run the script:\n      python solar_cell_dashboard.py\n   \n3. The dashboard window will appear, showing the latest solar cell research from arXiv.\n4. Double-click any article row to view its full details.\n5. Click the \"Refresh\" button to reload the latest articles.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes / Limitations\n\n- **Parsing:** The XML parsing is basic and uses regular expressions, which may not handle all edge cases. For robust parsing, consider using an XML parser like `xml.etree.ElementTree`.\n- **API Limits:** The script fetches only the 10 most recent articles. You can adjust `max_results` in the API URL for more/less.\n- **Internet Required:** Requires an active internet connection to fetch data from arXiv.\n-",

Brief Description\n\nThis Python script creates a simple desktop dashboard using Tkinter to display the latest research articles on solar cells from arXiv. It fetches recent articles via the arXiv API, parses the results, and presents them in a table. Users can refresh the data and view article details in a popup window.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n- **fetch_solar_cell_research()**\n  - Fetches the 10 most recent arXiv articles related to solar cells using the arXiv API.\n  - Handles network errors and returns a list of parsed articles.\n\n- **parse_arxiv_response(xml_text)**\n  - Performs basic parsing of the arXiv XML response using regular expressions.\n  - Extracts article title, authors, summary, published date, and link for each entry.\n\n- **update_dashboard()**\n  - Calls the fetch function and updates the Tkinter Treeview with the latest articles.\n\n- **show_article_details(event)**\n  - Displays a popup with full details (title, authors, summary, link) for the selected article when a user double-clicks a row.\n\n- **Tkinter GUI Setup**\n  - Sets up the main window, Treeview table, refresh button, and event bindings.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- Python 3.x\n- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `solar_cell_dashboard.py`).\n2. Run the script:\n      python solar_cell_dashboard.py\n   \n3. The dashboard window will appear, showing the latest solar cell research from arXiv.\n4. Double-click any article row to view its full details.\n5. Click the \"Refresh\" button to reload the latest articles.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes / Limitations\n\n- **Parsing:** The XML parsing is basic and uses regular expressions, which may not handle all edge cases. For robust parsing, consider using an XML parser like `xml.etree.ElementTree`.\n- **API Limits:** The script fetches only the 10 most recent articles. You can adjust `max_results` in the API URL for more/less.\n- **Internet Required:** Requires an active internet connection to fetch data from arXiv.\n-",

Brief Description\n\nThis script is a simple web scraper that fetches the HTML content of a given web page and extracts text from specified HTML tags (default: `<p>` for paragraphs). It demonstrates basic web scraping using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n- **fetch_webpage(url, timeout=10):**\n  - Fetches the HTML content of the specified URL.\n  - Handles HTTP errors and timeouts.\n  - Returns the raw HTML as a string.\n\n- **parse_html(html, tag='p'):**\n  - Parses the provided HTML content.\n  - Extracts and returns a list of text contents from all elements matching the specified tag (default: `'p'`).\n\n- **main():**\n  - Prompts the user for a URL.\n  - Fetches and parses the web page.\n  - Prints out all extracted paragraphs (or other specified tags).\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use / Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Install dependencies:  \n          pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n     \n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n      python <script_name>.py\n   \n\n3. **Follow the prompt:**  \n   - Enter the URL you wish to scrape when prompted.\n   - The script will display the extracted text from all `<p>` tags.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes / Limitations\n\n- **Robots.txt & Legal:**  \n  - The script does not check `robots.txt` or website scraping policies. Always ensure you have permission to scrape a site.\n\n- **JavaScript Content:**  \n  - Only static HTML is fetched. Content loaded dynamically via JavaScript will not be captured.\n\n- **Error Handling:**  \n  - Basic error handling is included for network issues, but not for all edge cases (e.g., invalid HTML).\n\n- **Extensibility:**  \n  - To extract other tags, modify the `tag` parameter in `parse_html`.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script is a starting point for web scraping tasks, suitable for extracting visible text from static HTML pages. For more complex scraping (e.g., handling logins, JavaScript, or large-scale crawling), consider using advanced tools like Scrapy or Selenium.",

It defines a function `bubble_sort` that takes a list as input and returns a new, sorted list without modifying the original. The code also includes an example of how to use the function.\n\n---\n\n**2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose**\n\n- **bubble_sort(arr):**\n  - **Purpose:** Sorts a given list `arr` in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - `arr` (list): The list to be sorted.\n  - **Returns:** \n    - A new list containing the sorted elements.\n  - **Raises:** \n    - `TypeError` if the input is not a list or contains elements that cannot be compared.\n\n---\n\n**3. How to Use/Run the Code**\n\n- Save the code in a Python file (e.g., `bubble_sort.py`).\n- Run the script directly. The example in the `__main__` block will execute, sorting the sample list and printing both the original and sorted lists.\n- To use the function with your own data, call `bubble_sort(your_list)`.\n\n**Example:**\nsample_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_list = bubble_sort(sample_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n\n---\n\n**4. Important Notes or Limitations**\n\n- **Input Validation:** The function checks that the input is a list and raises a `TypeError` otherwise.\n- **Element Comparability:** All elements in the list must be mutually comparable (i.e., support the '>' operator); otherwise, a `TypeError` is raised.\n- **Immutability:** The original list is not modified; a sorted copy is returned.\n- **Performance:** Bubble sort is not efficient for large lists (average/worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2)). For large datasets, consider using Python's built-in `sorted()` function or other efficient algorithms.\n- **No In-Place Sorting:** If you want to sort the list in place, modify the function accordingly or use `list.sort()`.\n\n---",

It defines a function `bubble_sort` that takes a list as input and returns a new, sorted list without modifying the original. The code also includes an example of how to use the function.\n\n---\n\n**2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose**\n\n- **bubble_sort(arr):**\n  - **Purpose:** Sorts a given list `arr` in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - `arr` (list): The list to be sorted.\n  - **Returns:** \n    - A new list containing the sorted elements.\n  - **Raises:** \n    - `TypeError` if the input is not a list or contains elements that cannot be compared.\n\n---\n\n**3. How to Use/Run the Code**\n\n- Save the code in a Python file (e.g., `bubble_sort.py`).\n- Run the script directly. The example in the `__main__` block will execute, sorting the sample list and printing both the original and sorted lists.\n- To use the function with your own data, call `bubble_sort(your_list)`.\n\n**Example:**\nsample_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_list = bubble_sort(sample_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n\n---\n\n**4. Important Notes or Limitations**\n\n- **Input Validation:** The function checks that the input is a list and raises a `TypeError` otherwise.\n- **Element Comparability:** All elements in the list must be mutually comparable (i.e., support the '>' operator); otherwise, a `TypeError` is raised.\n- **Immutability:** The original list is not modified; a sorted copy is returned.\n- **Performance:** Bubble sort is not efficient for large lists (average/worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2)). For large datasets, consider using Python's built-in `sorted()` function or other efficient algorithms.\n- **No In-Place Sorting:** If you want to sort the list in place, modify the function accordingly or use `list.sort()`.\n\n---",

It includes error handling for invalid input types and uncomparable elements, and demonstrates usage with a sample list.\n\n---\n\n**2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose**\n\n- **bubble_sort(arr):**\n  - **Purpose:** Sorts a given list `arr` in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n  - **Parameters:** `arr` (list) \u2013 The list to be sorted.\n  - **Returns:** A new sorted list (does not modify the original).\n  - **Raises:** `TypeError` if the input is not a list or if elements are not comparable.\n\n---\n\n**3. How to Use/Run the Code**\n\n1. Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `bubble_sort_example.py`).\n2. Run the file with Python:\n      python bubble_sort_example.py\n   \n3. The script will print the original and sorted lists using the sample data provided in the `__main__` block.\n4. To sort your own list, call `bubble_sort(your_list)`.\n\n---\n\n**4. Important Notes or Limitations**\n\n- **Input Validation:** The function only accepts lists. Passing other types will raise a `TypeError`.\n- **Element Comparability:** All elements in the list must be mutually comparable (e.g., all numbers or all strings).\n- **Performance:** Bubble sort is not efficient for large lists (average and worst-case time complexity is O(n\u00b2)).\n- **Non-destructive:** The original list is not modified; a sorted copy is returned.\n- **No Custom Sort Key:** The function does not support custom comparison logic (like the `key` parameter in Python's built-in `sorted`).",

Heapsort combines selection sort's efficiency with a superior data structure, enhancing sorting speed for large datasets.\n- **Algorithm Selection**: The choice of sorting algorithm significantly impacts performance and resource usage. Understanding the specific needs of the task at hand is crucial for selecting the most appropriate algorithm.\n\n### Important Findings and Data Points\n\n- **Memory Usage and In-Place Operations**:\n  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort have low memory usage (O(1)) and are in-place.\n  - Merge Sort requires more memory (O(n)) and is not in-place.\n  - Quick Sort and Heap Sort have moderate memory usage (O(log n) and O(n) respectively) and are not in-place.\n- **Performance Characteristics**:\n  - Bubble Sort is simple but impractical for large datasets.\n  - Merge Sort and Quick Sort offer consistent performance, making them suitable for larger, complex sorting tasks.\n  - HeapSort is efficient for memory-constrained environments.\n  - QuickSort is generally the fastest, while BubbleSort is the slowest.\n\n### Current State and Trends\n\n- **Technological Advancements**: Ongoing research is exploring areas like parallel processing and hybrid algorithms to further enhance sorting algorithm performance and efficiency.\n- **Future Outlook**: The future of sorting algorithms appears promising, with technological advancements paving the way for more efficient solutions. Staying updated on these trends is vital for those involved in data management.\n\n### Implications and Strategic Considerations\n\n- **Algorithm Suitability**: The choice of sorting algorithm should be based on the dataset size and distribution. For example, QuickSort, TimSort, and MergeSort are reliable for stable performance across various datasets.\n- **Resource Management**: HeapSort is a suitable choice when memory efficiency is a priority, whereas RadixSort is effective for small datasets but less so for larger, unevenly distributed datasets.\n- **Performance Optimization**: QuickSort is efficient for smaller datasets but may encounter issues with larger ones, especially with bimodal distributions. Understanding these nuances can guide strategic decisions in algorithm selection and implementation.",

It includes error handling for invalid input types and non-comparable elements.\n\n---\n\n**2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose**\n\n- **bubble_sort(arr):**\n  - Sorts a list `arr` using the bubble sort algorithm.\n  - Returns a new sorted list without modifying the original.\n  - Raises `TypeError` if the input is not a list.\n  - Raises `ValueError` if the list contains non-comparable elements.\n\n---\n\n**3. How to Use/Run the Code**\n\n- Save the code in a `.py` file.\n- Run the script directly. Example usage is provided in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block:\n    data = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n  sorted_data = bubble_sort(data)\n  print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_data)\n  \n- The original list and the sorted result will be printed.\n- If the input is invalid, an error message will be displayed.\n\n---\n\n**4. Important Notes or Limitations**\n\n- **Performance:** Bubble sort is not efficient for large lists (O(n\u00b2) time complexity).\n- **Input Validation:** Only accepts lists; all elements must be mutually comparable.\n- **Non-Destructive:** The original list is not modified; a sorted copy is returned.\n- **No Custom Key/Reverse:** Does not support custom sorting keys or descending order.\n- **Type Safety:** Will raise errors for non-list inputs or lists with unorderable elements (e.g., mixing numbers and strings).",

[...] With website structure changes, errors in scraping scripts can occur more frequently. It is crucial for engineers to implement robust monitoring and error handling mechanisms to detect and handle these errors effectively. This may involve setting up alerts for failed scrapes, implementing retry mechanisms, or logging errors for analysis and troubleshooting. [...] Web scraping, the process of extracting data from websites, can be a powerful tool for gathering information. However, one of the major challenges faced by web scraping engineers is the constant changes in website structures. These changes can render existing scraping methods obsolete and require engineers to adapt their strategies. In this article, we will explore some of the challenges generated by website structure changes and discuss strategies to overcome them.\n\n# 1. Dynamic HTML Elements",

It's an invaluable tool for collecting data from websites at scale to power applications, analytics, and research. Web scraping can be used to extract product prices, news articles, social media posts, and much more.\n\nThe web is full of public data and why not take advantage of it? Using Python we can scrape any page given the right techniques and tools so to start let's take a look at the main parts of web scraping. [...] All of these issues are difficult to handle but they can also be temporary and transient. For this, it's a good practice to equip every Python scraper with **retrying and failure handling** logic as a bare minimum to ensure they are robust and reliable.\n\nHere's an example how to retry `httpx` requests in Python using [tenacity](https://pypi.org/project/tenacity/) general purpose retrying library:",

Additionally, websites can purposefully change CSSattribute names, classes, element IDs, and entire site structures specifically to counter web scrapers. All this requires continuous scraper upkeep to adjust CSS or XPath selectors as well as the scraping logic. You can try out the following advanced methods to make your processes easier: [...] Create selectors using attributes or elements that are less likely to change, such as id attributes that are consistent, heading tags like <h1> and <h2>, or custom data attributes.\n\nImplement a mechanism to detect changes in the structure and adapt the scraping logic automatically. A basic HTML structure change detection mechanism would require you to remove the text from the HTML file, leaving only tags and classes like shown below: [...] previous_html = f.read()\nexcept FileNotFoundError as e:\nprint(f\"Error: {e}\")\ncurrent_html = fetch_html(url)\nif strip_to_tags(previous_html) != strip_to_tags(current_html):\nwith open(\"previous_html.html\", \"w\") as f:\nf.write(current_html)\nprint(\"HTML structure has changed.\")\nelse:\nprint(\"No structure changes detected.\")\ncompare_structure()`",

However, by understanding these challenges and employing appropriate strategies, such as handling dynamic HTML elements, adapting to CSS selector changes, overcoming anti-scraping measures, and implementing robust monitoring and error handling, engineers can ensure the success and reliability of their web scraping projects. [...] With website structure changes, errors in scraping scripts can occur more frequently. It is crucial for engineers to implement robust monitoring and error handling mechanisms to detect and handle these errors effectively. This may involve setting up alerts for failed scrapes, implementing retry mechanisms, or logging errors for analysis and troubleshooting. [...] Web scraping, the process of extracting data from websites, can be a powerful tool for gathering information. However, one of the major challenges faced by web scraping engineers is the constant changes in website structures. These changes can render existing scraping methods obsolete and require engineers to adapt their strategies. In this article, we will explore some of the challenges generated by website structure changes and discuss strategies to overcome them.\n\n# 1. Dynamic HTML Elements",

On the other hand, BERT and GPT are designed to perform a wide array of tasks, and they excel at transfer learning. This difference underscores the versatility of BERT and GPT, while also [...] GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model developed by OpenAI. The third iteration in the GPT series, GPT-3 builds upon the success of its predecessors by scaling up the architecture and leveraging a massive amount of pre-training data. In contrast to BERT, GPT is based on the decoder-only Transformer architecture (Fig. 2). This section will explore the core insights of GPT, and highlight its important features that contribute to its success while [...] based on its preceding context. This increased efficiency in training enables GPT to scale up to larger architectures and datasets, resulting in improved performance and language understanding. In contrast, BERT uses masked language modeling, which involves masking a fixed subset of words and predicting them based on bidirectional context, requiring more computational resources during training.",
