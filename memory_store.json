Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n- Visualizing the vulnerability of various sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sector_data)**  \n  Plots a bar chart showing how vulnerable different sectors are to quantum attacks, based on provided scores.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class)**  \n  Implements the Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS), a hash-based, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme.\n  - `generate_keypair()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n  - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n  - `verify(message, signature, public_key)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n- **main()**  \n  Runs the analysis and demonstration:\n  - Plots sector vulnerabilities.\n  - Demonstrates key generation, signing, and verification with Lamport OTS, including a tampered message test.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   Save the code to a `.py` file and execute:\n      python script_name.py\n   \n\n3. **Output:**  \n   - A bar chart visualizing sector vulnerabilities.\n   - Console output showing Lamport OTS signature generation, validation, and detection of tampering.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:**  \n  Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n- **Sector vulnerability scores are illustrative:**  \n  Real-world risk assessments may differ.\n- **No persistent storage:**  \n  Keys and signatures exist only in memory during execution.\n- **Quantum resistance:**  \n  Lamport OTS is believed to be resistant to quantum attacks, but practical deployment requires more robust schemes (e.g., Merkle signatures).\n\n---",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing the vulnerability of various industry sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant cryptographic primitive: the Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions / Classes\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the relative vulnerability of different sectors to quantum computing attacks.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is resistant to quantum attacks.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time key pair (private and public keys).\n    - `sign(message, sk)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, pk)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use / Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   Execute the script directly:\n      python script_name.py\n   \n\n3. **What happens:**  \n   - A bar chart will be displayed, visualizing sector vulnerabilities.\n   - The Lamport OTS demo will:\n     - Generate a key pair.\n     - Sign a sample message.\n     - Verify the signature (should be valid).\n     - Attempt verification on a tampered message (should be invalid).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes / Limitations\n\n- **Data:**  \n  - Vulnerability scores are illustrative and not based on real-world measurements.\n\n- **Lamport OTS:**\n  - **One-time use only:** Each key pair must only be used to sign a single message.\n  - **Not for production:** This is a demonstration; real-world post-quantum cryptography requires more robust schemes and secure key management.\n  - **Large keys/signatures:** Lamport OTS is not space-efficient compared to modern schemes.\n\n- **Visualization:**  \n  - The chart is for illustrative purposes and does not reflect actual sector vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a basic overview and demonstration of quantum threats to cybersecurity, visualizes at-risk sectors, and introduces a simple quantum-resistant signature scheme for educational purposes.",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by visualizing the vulnerability of various sectors to quantum attacks. It also demonstrates a sample implementation of a quantum-resistant, hash-based digital signature scheme\u2014Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing how vulnerable different sectors are to quantum computing attacks based on hypothetical scores.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a simple Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - **keygen():** Generates a private/public key pair for Lamport OTS.\n    - **sign(message):** Signs a message using the private key.\n    - **verify(message, signature, public_key):** Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Execution:**  \n   - Run the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Generate a Lamport OTS key pair.\n     - Sign a sample message.\n     - Verify the signature (should be valid).\n     - Attempt verification on a tampered message (should be invalid).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is One-Time Only:**  \n  Each key pair must only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n\n- **Demonstration Purposes Only:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n\n- **Vulnerability Scores are Hypothetical:**  \n  The sector vulnerability data is illustrative and not based on real-world assessments.\n\n- **No Key Management:**  \n  The code does not handle secure key storage or management.\n\n- **Quantum Resistance:**  \n  Lamport OTS is considered quantum-resistant, but practical deployment requires more advanced schemes (e.g., Merkle signatures).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visualization of quantum-related cybersecurity risks and a hands-on demonstration of a basic quantum-resistant signature algorithm.

How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Execution:**  \n   - Run the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Generate a Lamport OTS key pair.\n     - Sign a sample message.\n     - Verify the signature (should be valid).\n     - Attempt verification on a tampered message (should be invalid).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is One-Time Only:**  \n  Each key pair must only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n\n- **Demonstration Purposes Only:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n\n- **Vulnerability Scores are Hypothetical:**  \n  The sector vulnerability data is illustrative and not based on real-world assessments.\n\n- **No Key Management:**  \n  The code does not handle secure key storage or management.\n\n- **Quantum Resistance:**  \n  Lamport OTS is considered quantum-resistant, but practical deployment requires more advanced schemes (e.g., Merkle signatures).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visualization of quantum-related cybersecurity risks and a hands-on demonstration of a basic quantum-resistant signature algorithm.

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing the vulnerability of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a data visualization and a sample implementation of a hash-based signature algorithm, which is resistant to quantum attacks (unlike RSA/ECC).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing the vulnerability scores (0-10) of various sectors to quantum threats.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme.\n    - `generate_keypair()`: Generates a private/public key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message (bytes) using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, public_key=None)`: Verifies a signature for a given message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Running the Code:**  \n   - Save the script as a `.py` file.\n   - Run from the command line:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Demonstrate Lamport OTS: generate keys, sign a message, verify the signature, and show verification failure on a tampered message.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is for demonstration only:**  \n  - It is a \"one-time\" signature: each key pair must only be used to sign one message.\n  - Not suitable for production or real-world cryptographic use without enhancements (e.g., key management, Merkle trees).\n  - The implementation is simplified and not hardened for security.\n\n- **Vulnerability scores are illustrative:**  \n  - The sector vulnerability data is hypothetical and for visualization purposes only.\n\n- **Quantum-resistance:**  \n  - Lamport OTS is believed to be secure against quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC.\n\n- **Error Handling:**  \n  - Basic error handling is included, but not exhaustive.\n\n---\n\n**",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- **Visualizing** the vulnerability of various critical sectors to quantum attacks.\n- **Demonstrating** a simplified, sample implementation of a quantum-resistant (lattice-based) key exchange algorithm.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores)**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability of each sector to quantum threats.\n\n- **hash_function(data: bytes)**\n  - Computes a SHA-256 hash of the input data (used in key generation and secret derivation).\n\n- **generate_private_key(length=32)**\n  - Generates a cryptographically secure random private key of specified length.\n\n- **generate_public_key(private_key: bytes, public_param: bytes)**\n  - Creates a public key by hashing the concatenation of a private key and a public parameter (for demonstration only).\n\n- **derive_shared_secret(private_key: bytes, other_public_key: bytes)**\n  - Derives a shared secret by hashing the concatenation of a private key and the other party's public key.\n\n- **demo_lattice_key_exchange()**\n  - Demonstrates the key exchange process between two parties (Alice and Bob) using the above primitives and prints the resulting shared secrets.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed (`pip install matplotlib numpy`)\n\n2. **Run the Script:**  \n   - Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `quantum_cybersecurity_demo.py`)\n   - Execute:  \n          python quantum_cybersecurity_demo.py\n     \n\n3. **Output:**  \n   - A bar chart visualizing sector vulnerabilities.\n   - Console output showing the key exchange process and whether both parties derive the same shared secret.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes & Limitations\n\n- **Visualization Data:**  \n  - Vulnerability scores are hypothetical and for demonstration only.\n\n- **Quantum-Resistant Algorithm:**  \n  - The lattice-based key exchange is highly simplified and **not secure** for real-world use.\n  - Real implementations should use standardized, peer-reviewed algorithms (e.g., Kyber, NTRU).\n\n- **Security",

Robust defences on historical data take many years, so it is advisable to start migration now. Connected to this, the American public agency, The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has been developing classical encryption standards designed against quantum computing, such as Shor\u2019s and Grover\u2019s algorithms, and the official standards will likely be [...] A standard approach combines classical and PQC algorithms in a hybrid system. Unique to the hybrid, classical-PQC system is its dual security. Its PQC element is meant to protect against quantum decryption. Conversely, in the event of an unforeseen classical exploit in the new Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, the reliable classical component of the hybrid system would remain steadfast. This hybrid approach simultaneously maintains necessary certifications and compliance standards.",

Description\n\nThis script analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- **Visualizing** which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (using a bar chart).\n- **Demonstrating** a simple, toy implementation of a quantum-resistant (lattice-based) encryption scheme, showing basic key generation, encryption, and decryption of a single bit.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Functions and Their Purpose\n\n### Data Visualization\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores)**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing hypothetical vulnerability scores (0-100) for various industry sectors to quantum computing threats.\n\n### Toy Lattice-based Encryption (Quantum-Resistant)\n\n- **generate_keypair(n=8, q=257)**\n  - Generates a toy public/private key pair for a lattice-based cryptosystem.\n  - Returns: `(public_key, private_key)`.\n\n- **encrypt_bit(bit, public_key, q=257)**\n  - Encrypts a single bit (0 or 1) using the public key.\n  - Returns: `(u, v)` ciphertext.\n\n- **decrypt_bit(ciphertext, sk, q=257)**\n  - Decrypts a single bit from the ciphertext using the private key.\n  - Returns: `bit` (0 or 1).\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Use / Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Running the Script:**  \n   - Save the code to a `.py` file.\n   - Run from the command line:  \n          python your_script.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Run a demo of the toy lattice-based encryption: generate keys, encrypt a bit, decrypt it, and print the results.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Important Notes & Limitations\n\n- **Visualization Data:**  \n  - The vulnerability scores are hypothetical and for demonstration only.\n\n- **Encryption Algorithm:**  \n  - The lattice-based encryption is a **toy example** for educational purposes.\n  - It is **not secure** for real-world use. Real post-quantum cryptography is significantly more complex.\n  - Only supports encryption of a single bit at a time.\n\n- **Error",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the potential impact of quantum computing on various cybersecurity sectors, visualizes sector vulnerabilities, and demonstrates a simple quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature, OTS).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic, hash-based, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time private/public key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, public_key=None)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Packages: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   - Execute the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Demonstrate Lamport OTS: sign a message, verify the signature, and show that tampering with the message invalidates the signature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature scheme:**  \n  - Each key pair should only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **Vulnerability scores are hypothetical:**  \n  - The sector vulnerability data is illustrative, not based on real-world assessments.\n- **No persistent key storage:**  \n  - Keys exist only in memory for demonstration.\n- **Lamport OTS is for educational/demo purposes:**  \n  - Not suitable for production use due to key/signature size and one-time limitation.\n- **Quantum resistance:**  \n  - Lamport OTS is believed to be secure against quantum attacks, unlike many classical signature schemes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visual overview of quantum threats to cybersecurity sectors and a hands-on example of a quantum-resistant signature, highlighting the need for post-quantum cryptography.",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the potential impact of quantum computing on various cybersecurity sectors, visualizes sector vulnerabilities, and demonstrates a simple quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature, OTS).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(sectors, scores):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n\n- **class LamportOTS:**\n  - Implements a basic, hash-based, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time private/public key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature, public_key=None)`: Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   - Python 3.x  \n   - Packages: `matplotlib`, `numpy`\n\n2. **Run the script:**  \n   - Execute the script directly:  \n          python script_name.py\n     \n   - The script will:\n     - Display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n     - Demonstrate Lamport OTS: sign a message, verify the signature, and show that tampering with the message invalidates the signature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature scheme:**  \n  - Each key pair should only be used to sign a single message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **Vulnerability scores are hypothetical:**  \n  - The sector vulnerability data is illustrative, not based on real-world assessments.\n- **No persistent key storage:**  \n  - Keys exist only in memory for demonstration.\n- **Lamport OTS is for educational/demo purposes:**  \n  - Not suitable for production use due to key/signature size and one-time limitation.\n- **Quantum resistance:**  \n  - Lamport OTS is believed to be secure against quantum attacks, unlike many classical signature schemes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis script provides a visual overview of quantum threats to cybersecurity sectors and a hands-on example of a quantum-resistant signature, highlighting the need for post-quantum cryptography.",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing the estimated vulnerability of various sectors to quantum attacks.\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant cryptographic primitive: the Lamport One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme.\n- Providing a sample implementation and demonstration of signing and verifying messages using Lamport OTS.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n#### **Visualization**\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a bar chart showing the vulnerability (in %) of different sectors to quantum attacks.\n\n#### **Quantum-Resistant Algorithm**\n- **LamportOTS class:**\n  - Implements the Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, a basic post-quantum (quantum-resistant) signature algorithm.\n  - **keygen():** Generates a private/public key pair.\n  - **sign(message):** Signs a message (as bytes) using the private key.\n  - **verify(message, signature, public_key=None):** Verifies a signature against a message and public key.\n\n#### **Demonstration**\n- **demo_lamport_ots():**\n  - Demonstrates key generation, signing, and verification using Lamport OTS, including a test with a tampered message.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**  \n   Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `numpy` installed:\n      pip install matplotlib numpy\n   \n\n2. **Run the Script:**  \n   Execute the script directly:\n      python <script_name>.py\n   \n   - This will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate Lamport OTS signing and verification, printing results to the console.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature scheme:**  \n  Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **Demo is for educational purposes:**  \n  The Lamport OTS implementation is simplified and not suitable for production use.\n- **Sector vulnerability data is illustrative:**  \n  The vulnerability percentages are example estimates, not based on real-world analysis.\n- **No persistent key storage:**  \n  Keys are generated and used in-memory only.\n- **Quantum-resistance:**",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (based on reliance on classical cryptography).\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a visual overview and a sample implementation of a post-quantum cryptographic primitive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing vulnerability scores (0\u2013100) for various sectors, illustrating which are most at risk from quantum computing threats.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class):**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature)`: Verifies a signature against a message and the public key.\n\n- **main():**\n  - Runs the visualization and demonstrates the Lamport OTS by signing and verifying a message, and showing signature invalidity if the message is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**\n   - Python 3.x\n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**\n      python script_name.py\n   \n   - The script will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate the Lamport OTS by signing a message, verifying it, and showing that tampering with the message causes verification to fail.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:** Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:** The LamportOTS implementation is educational and not suitable for production use.\n- **No persistent key storage:** Keys are generated in-memory and discarded after use.\n- **Vulnerability data is illustrative:** The sector vulnerability scores are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only.\n- **Quantum resistance:** The Lamport OTS is secure against known quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC, but is not practical for general use due to large key/signature sizes",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (based on reliance on classical cryptography).\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a visual overview and a sample implementation of a post-quantum cryptographic primitive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing vulnerability scores (0\u2013100) for various sectors, illustrating which are most at risk from quantum computing threats.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class):**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature)`: Verifies a signature against a message and the public key.\n\n- **main():**\n  - Runs the visualization and demonstrates the Lamport OTS by signing and verifying a message, and showing signature invalidity if the message is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**\n   - Python 3.x\n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**\n      python script_name.py\n   \n   - The script will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate the Lamport OTS by signing a message, verifying it, and showing that tampering with the message causes verification to fail.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:** Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:** The LamportOTS implementation is educational and not suitable for production use.\n- **No persistent key storage:** Keys are generated in-memory and discarded after use.\n- **Vulnerability data is illustrative:** The sector vulnerability scores are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only.\n- **Quantum resistance:** The Lamport OTS is secure against known quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC, but is not practical for general use due to large key/signature sizes",

Brief Description\n\nThis code analyzes the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity by:\n\n- Visualizing which industry sectors are most vulnerable to quantum attacks (based on reliance on classical cryptography).\n- Demonstrating a simple, quantum-resistant digital signature scheme (Lamport One-Time Signature).\n\nIt provides both a visual overview and a sample implementation of a post-quantum cryptographic primitive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Purpose\n\n- **plot_vulnerable_sectors(vulnerability_dict):**\n  - Plots a horizontal bar chart showing vulnerability scores (0\u2013100) for various sectors, illustrating which are most at risk from quantum computing threats.\n\n- **LamportOTS (class):**\n  - Implements a basic Lamport One-Time Signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant.\n    - `keygen()`: Generates a one-time public/private key pair.\n    - `sign(message)`: Signs a message using the private key.\n    - `verify(message, signature)`: Verifies a signature against a message and the public key.\n\n- **main():**\n  - Runs the visualization and demonstrates the Lamport OTS by signing and verifying a message, and showing signature invalidity if the message is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use/Run the Code\n\n1. **Requirements:**\n   - Python 3.x\n   - `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed\n\n2. **Run the script:**\n      python script_name.py\n   \n   - The script will display a bar chart of sector vulnerabilities.\n   - It will then demonstrate the Lamport OTS by signing a message, verifying it, and showing that tampering with the message causes verification to fail.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Important Notes or Limitations\n\n- **Lamport OTS is a one-time signature:** Each key pair should only be used to sign one message. Reusing keys compromises security.\n- **For demonstration only:** The LamportOTS implementation is educational and not suitable for production use.\n- **No persistent key storage:** Keys are generated in-memory and discarded after use.\n- **Vulnerability data is illustrative:** The sector vulnerability scores are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only.\n- **Quantum resistance:** The Lamport OTS is secure against known quantum attacks, unlike RSA/ECC, but is not practical for general use due to large key/signature sizes",
